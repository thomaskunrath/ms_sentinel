Here is a certificate for the completion of the Implementing and Administering Microsoft Sentinel course. This course sparked my curiosity about Sentinel, and I began developing a "how-to" guide on deploying it. The guide starts with the basics, from installing and running a virtual machine to deploying Microsoft Sentinel.

Please note that this is study material and may not be entirely accurate. It is not intended for use in a professional environment, as I am still building proficiency in Microsoft Sentinel.
